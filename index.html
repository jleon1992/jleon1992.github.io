            <h4 class="display-4">Why am I creating this site?</h4>
            <p>This is my first official portfolio website. I was waiting until I became an expert web developer to create a website that I am proud of.
                While this is still my intention it has grown into something I can work on while I am on my quest to become a fully independent web developer.
                I am hoping to share this webpage with other fellow programmers on forums for support and inspiration. My final goal for this website 
                is that it serves as a resume for future employers. I hope that through this website they will be able to see my work for exactly
                what it is. If done correctly this website will truly help employers make a decision as to whether I would be a valuable asset to 
                their team, saving time and money for everybody.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I also intend on making this website fully interactive, and responsive, allowing anyone to contact me with any questions related to 
                my work, programming, ideas, or anything else that is relevant.
            </p>
